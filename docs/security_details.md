 Your frontend code is correct in how it requests data and expects authentication. If the JWT token is not being transmitted from backend to frontend, the most common causes are:

1. **Cookie settings:**  
   - The backend sets the JWT as a cookie (`access_token`) with `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `sameSite` flags.
   - If `sameSite` is `"strict"` or `"lax"` and your frontend and backend are on different domains or ports, the browser may block the cookie.
   - If `secure: true`, cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

2. **CORS settings:**  
   - The backend must set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` and the frontend must use `credentials: 'include'` (which your `apiFetch` does).
   - The backend must set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the exact frontend origin, not `*`.

3. **Domain mismatch:**  
   - Cookies are only sent to the domain that set them. If your frontend is on `localhost:3000` and backend on `localhost:4000`, cookies may not be sent unless CORS and cookie settings are correct.

4. **Proxy issues:**  
   - If using a proxy (like Vercel, Netlify, or a custom reverse proxy), it may strip or block cookies.

**How to debug:**
- Check the `Set-Cookie` header in the login response in your browser’s network tab. Is it present? Is it blocked (yellow warning)?
- Check if the cookie is present in the browser’s storage after login.
- Check if the cookie is sent with subsequent API requests.

**How to fix:**
- Ensure backend CORS config includes:
  - `credentials: true`
  - `origin: [your frontend URL]`
- Set cookies with:
  - `sameSite: "none"` (for cross-site) and `secure: true` (must use HTTPS)
- Make sure frontend uses `credentials: 'include'` (already done).

If you want, I can review your backend CORS and cookie settings for you—just let me know!

=============================================================================================
 Your logs show that the CSRF token request succeeds, but the `/auth/session` request returns a 401 Unauthorized. This means the browser is not sending the authentication cookie (JWT) with the request, or the backend is not accepting it.

**Checklist to fix this:**

1. **Backend CORS and Cookie Settings:**
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
   - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` must be the exact frontend URL (not `*`)
   - Cookies must be set with `SameSite: "none"` and `Secure: true` for cross-site requests (which is required for Render + Netlify/Vercel setups).

2. **Frontend Fetch:**
   - You are already using `credentials: 'include'` in your `apiFetch` utility, which is correct.

3. **HTTPS Requirement:**
   - Both frontend and backend must be served over HTTPS for cookies with `Secure: true` to work.

4. **Check Set-Cookie Header:**
   - After login, inspect the response in the browser’s network tab. Is the `Set-Cookie` header present? Is it blocked or marked as "cross-site" or "blocked"?

5. **Domain/Path Mismatch:**
   - The cookie domain and path must match the backend API domain and the requests being made.

**What to do next:**
- Double-check your backend CORS and cookie settings.
- Make sure you are logging in from the same domain as the one you are using for API requests.
- If you want, paste your backend CORS and cookie config here and I’ll review it for you.

This is a deployment/config issue, not a frontend code bug. Let me know if you want a backend config review!

**Summary:**  
The most critical files for backend review are:
- backend/src/app.ts (main express app, CORS, CSRF, cookie, security, and route setup)
- backend/src/server.ts (server and environment loader)
- backend/src/middleware/auth.ts (JWT and authentication logic)
- backend/src/api/auth/* (all authentication endpoints)
- backend/src/middleware/helmet.ts (security headers)
- backend/src/middleware/errorHandler.ts (error handling)

If you want to review or debug a specific aspect (e.g., CORS, JWT, cookies, CSRF, or a particular endpoint), let me know and I can narrow down the relevant code further.Here’s a review of your backend authentication, CORS, and cookie setup based on the provided files:

---

### 1. **CORS and Cookie Settings**

- **CORS** is configured with:
  - `origin`: An array of allowed origins (including your production and localhost domains).
  - `credentials: true`: This is correct for allowing cookies to be sent cross-origin.
  - `allowedHeaders`: Includes `"Content-Type"`, `"Authorization"`, and `"x-csrf-token"`.

- **Cookies** (in login, refresh, etc.) are set with:
  - `httpOnly: true`
  - `secure: true` (only sent over HTTPS)
  - `sameSite: "none"` (required for cross-site cookies)
  - `path: "/"`

**This is the correct setup for cross-site authentication with cookies.**

---

### 2. **Common Pitfalls to Check**

- **Frontend must use `credentials: 'include'`** (which your code does).
- **Backend must respond with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`** (your CORS config does this).
- **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` must NOT be `*`**. Your config uses an array, which is correct, but some CORS libraries require a function to echo back the request origin for credentials to work. If you see CORS errors, consider switching to a function for `origin` in your CORS config.

---

### 3. **JWT Authentication**

- All protected routes use the `authenticateJWT` middleware.
- JWTs are set as cookies, not returned in the response body.
- The `/auth/session` route is protected and expects the cookie to be present.

---

### 4. **CSRF Protection**

- CSRF is handled with the `csurf` middleware and a `/csrf-token` endpoint.
- The CSRF token is required for mutating requests.

---

### 5. **Potential Issues**

- **If cookies are not being sent:**  
  - Make sure both frontend and backend are served over HTTPS in production.
  - Make sure the browser is not blocking third-party cookies.
  - If using a proxy (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), ensure it forwards cookies and does not strip them.
  - If you still get 401s, check the browser’s network tab for the `Set-Cookie` header after login and for the presence of the cookie in subsequent requests.

- **If CORS errors appear:**  
  - Some CORS middleware require `origin` to be a function that returns the request’s origin when `credentials: true` is set. If you see CORS errors, try:
    ```js
    origin: (origin, callback) => {
      const allowed = [/* your domains */];
      if (allowed.includes(origin)) return callback(null, true);
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
    ```

---

### 6. **Summary**

- Your backend config is correct for secure, cross-site authentication with cookies.
- If you are still getting 401s, the issue is likely with cookie transmission (browser, HTTPS, or proxy), not with your backend code.
